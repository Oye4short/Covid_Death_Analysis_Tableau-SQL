# SQL Covid Death Analysis Summary 
The SQL code conducts data exploration on Covid deaths, utilizing a database named NewPortfolioProject([Data Set](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)). The code comprises several queries focusing on different aspects of Covid-related data analysis.<br><br>
**1.	Selecting Initial Data:** The initial query retrieves all columns from the Covid_Deaths table where the continent is not null, ordering the results by the third and fourth columns.<br><br>
**2.	Basic Covid Statistics:** The second query selects specific columns (Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population) from Covid_Deaths, filtering records where the continent is not null and ordering by location and date.<br><br>
**3.	Percentage Death per Covid Cases:** This query calculates the death percentage per Covid cases, displaying Location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, and the calculated DeathPercentage. Results are ordered by location and date.<br><br>
**4.	Total Cases vs. Population:** The query presents data on location, date, population, total_cases, and the percentage of the population infected with Covid. The results are ordered by location and date.<br><br>
**5.	Countries with Highest Infection Rate:** This query identifies countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population, displaying Location, Population, HighestInfectionCount, and InfectedPopulationPercentage. Results are grouped by location and ordered by the percentage in descending order.<br><br>
**6.	Countries with Highest Death Count:** The query lists countries with the highest death count, without considering the population. Results include Location and TotalDeathCount, ordered by the total death count in descending order.<br><br>
**7.	Breaking Down by Continent:** Several queries analyze Covid death data by continent, showcasing the continents with the highest death count per population. The last query calculates the total cases, total deaths, and death percentage, grouping by date and ordered accordingly.<br><br>
**8.	Covid Vaccinations Analysis:** The code then shifts to analyzing Covid vaccination data, joining the Covid_Deaths and Covid_Vaccinations tables based on location and date.<br><br>
**9.	Rolling Vaccination Calculation:** Multiple queries calculate rolling vaccinations and the percentage of the population vaccinated, with the results stored in a temporary table and later used to create a view named PercentPopulationVaccinated.<br><br>
**10.	View for Visualization:** The final part creates a view, PercentPopulationVaccinated, incorporating continent, location, date, population, new_vaccinations, and the calculated PercentageRollingVac. The view is then queried to display its contents.<br><br>
In summary, the SQL code explores and analyzes various aspects of Covid data, providing insights into infection rates, death percentages, vaccination trends, and population impact.
